## Special offer (selling marker)-

### Requirement- Special offer selling marker should come when 3 or more than 3 marketplace leave content chat after offering it.
**This can only manage when it will be manage from admin**

**Solution**
1. We should have a promocode management system in the admin panel.
2. From admin panel, we can create promocodes.
3. There, we should have a popup, where list of content will come.
4. Admin can create a promocode with any offer(% wise or flat), via choosing the content.
5. Then we can see all the promocode in the listing.
6. We can also delete and update the promocode.
7. Those content will come in the listing which are offered by 3 or more than 3 users.
8. After create a content, we can find a toggle in every promocode, which will give us more controll, so that we can decide, when we should send this promocode to marketplace.
9. When we will toggle the button then notification will go to those marketplace who made offers and neither they bought nor they cancel.
10. So marketplace will get a notification, there he can find a promocode.
11. When marketplace will receive a notification, then from where he left the chat, there he can find an option to apply promocode and buy the content.
12. Also they can see a selling marker on medium view container.
13. In this way, admin will have more control on special offer content.


## Flow of Presshop chat-
1. There will be a chat between mediahouse and presshop admin.
2. From development point of view, there will be a group chat between all users of a mediahouse with owner and all sub admins with admin.
3. This group chat can only start from mediahouse.
4. Anybody can send messages but dp and name will show in chat.
5. When a new user creates then backend will find his mediahouse in all rooms and wherever he gets, he will assign user id into presshop room chat.
6. When a new sub admin will be created then we have to assign his id in all rooms.
7. In this way there will be a single room between mediahouse and presshop with their sub admin and users.
8. There will be a single tick and double tick for better understanding of reading messages.

**Step 1 -** One to one chat between marketplace admin and presshop admin.
**Step 2 -** Chat between marketplace, his all users and presshop admin.
**Step 3 -** Chat between marketplace, his all users and presshop admin, his all sub admins.
**Step 4 -** Chat between marketplace, his all users, upcoming new users and presshop admin, sub admin, upcoming new sub admin.

## Flow of testimonial-
1. Testimonial = Rating and review given by all publications, 
2. It should be manageble from admin.
3. From rating and review page, publication can give rating and review.
4. There should be a section where all rating and review will be listed.
5. Admin can see listing and delete it.

**Extra functionality** - If the admin wants the selected rating and review to be shown in the marketplace, we can make that happen.
